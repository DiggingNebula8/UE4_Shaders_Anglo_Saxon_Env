# Anglo Saxon Env v0.1.0a

## Design Choices

### Design Changes

### Design Workflow

Chosen the following workflow to make our project eloquent.

- _Empathise_ - the needs - because it allows us to set aside one's opinions and gain real insight into users and their needs.
- _Define_ - the accumulated information - to analyse the observations and synthesise them to establish the core problem.
- _Ideate_ - generate ideas - to solve the problems with the rooted background of knowledge gathered in the past stages. By seeking an alternative way to view the problem and identify innovative solutions.
- _Prototype_ - create solutions - several inexpensive, scaled-down versions of the product until we finalise an exceptional solution.
- _Test_ - try the solution - the product rigorously using the best solutions identified in the Prototype phase. Whilst being flexible to return to previous stages in the process to make further iterations, alterations and refinements to rule out alternative solutions.
- _Build_ - finalise the solution - get feedbacks and present the build.
